    "text": "1.1.1 What is Risk?\nRisk is the exposure to uncertainty that can lead to variation in outcomes, particularly adverse outcomes that result in losses or failure to achieve objectives. Simply put: risk is the possibility that bad things might happen.\nThe key distinction to understand:\n\nUncertainty means we don’t know what will happen\nRisk means we can estimate the probabilities of different outcomes\n\nWhen we talk about risk in practice, we’re actually referring to three interconnected components:\n\nRisk Driver - The underlying source of uncertainty (what could change?)\nRisk Position - The amount exposed to that uncertainty (how much is at stake?)\nRisk Exposure - The potential impact from that position (what could we gain or lose?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nConsider a company holding ¥1,000,000 when news from Japan could move the currency by ±1%:\n\nThe risk driver is the ±1% currency movement\nThe risk position is ¥1,000,000\nThe risk exposure is ±¥10,000 potential impact\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Risk Management: Optimization, Not Elimination\nRisk management is the process of defining acceptable risk levels, measuring current risk, and adjusting exposure to achieve organizational objectives. The critical insight: risk management aims to optimize value, not minimize risk.\nWhy? Because risk and return are inseparable. We cannot directly control returns—we can only manage risk to influence expected outcomes. This leads to the fundamental principle of finance: there is no free lunch. Higher returns require accepting higher risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nConsider these investment options:\n\nGovernment Bonds: ~2-3% annual return with minimal risk\nCorporate Bonds: ~5-7% return with moderate default risk\nStartup Equity: 20%+ potential returns with high probability of total loss\n\nThe goal isn’t to avoid the startup investment—it’s to understand the risk-return tradeoff and choose appropriately based on objectives and risk tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 The Risk Landscape: Financial and Non-Financial Risks\nOrganizations face two broad categories of risk that frequently interact and amplify each other.\n\nFinancial Risks\nMarket Risk stems from changes in market prices and rates. Market risk includes equity price movements, interest rate changes, foreign exchange fluctuations, and commodity price volatility.\nCredit Risk is the possibility that a counterparty won’t meet their obligations. The challenge with credit risk is its rarity—defaults are infrequent events with limited historical data, requiring estimation through credit spreads, rating models, and financial ratio analysis.\nLiquidity Risk manifests in two forms:\n\nFunding liquidity risk: inability to meet payment obligations\nMarket liquidity risk: inability to exit positions without significant losses\n\nThe 2008 crisis demonstrated this dramatically when mortgage-backed securities became essentially unsellable at any reasonable price. The risk isn’t just wider bid-ask spreads (a known cost) but the uncertainty of spreads widening unpredictably, especially during stress periods.\n\n\nNon-Financial Risks\nOperational Risk arises from failed processes, people, systems, or external events. These events are typically low-frequency but high-impact, making them difficult to predict and quantify.\nStrategic Risk emerges from poor business decisions or flawed execution.\nReputation Risk can destroy value rapidly, especially in our social media age. It often results from other risk events and spreads faster than organizations can respond.\nModel Risk occurs when we use wrong models or misapply correct ones. All models simplify reality—the danger comes when we forget these limitations. Models fail in predictable ways.\nTail Risk represents extreme “black swan” events that occur more frequently than normal distributions suggest. These outlier events in the probability distribution’s tails can devastate unprepared organizations.\n\n\nThe Critical Distinction: Systematic vs. Idiosyncratic Risk\nSystematic risk affects entire markets or economies—interest rate changes, recessions, geopolitical events. It cannot be diversified away.\nIdiosyncratic risk is specific to individual companies or assets. While diversification can reduce it, the 2008 crisis showed how idiosyncratic risks can evolve into systematic ones when individual firm failures trigger system-wide contagion.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Risk Interactions: When 1+1 = 3\nRisks rarely occur in isolation. They interact, amplify each other, and cascade through organizations in non-linear ways. The 2008 Financial Crisis provides a textbook cascade:\n\nHousing prices decline (market risk)\nMortgage defaults surge (credit risk)\n\nMBS securities become illiquid (liquidity risk)\nBanks face funding crises (funding liquidity risk)\nCounterparty concerns explode (credit risk amplification)\nSystem-wide crisis emerges (systemic risk)\n\nThis cascade illustrates wrong-way risk—when exposure increases precisely as counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Banks buying credit protection from AIG, which was itself exposed to the same mortgage risks, exemplified this fatal correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe lesson: risk models often fail to capture these interactions, making scenario planning and stress testing essential for identifying potential risk cascades before they occur.",

    "section": "1.2 The Risk Management Process",
    "text": "1.2 The Risk Management Process\n\n1.2.1 The Five-Step Risk Management Cycle\nRisk management isn’t a one-time exercise—it’s a continuous cycle that integrates risk considerations into every organizational decision. The process flows through five interconnected steps, each building on the previous while feeding back into a continuous loop of improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cycle operates within a broader framework that provides structure and support:\n\nRisk Governance establishes the top-down direction, ensuring risk management aligns with organizational objectives.\nRisk Infrastructure provides the people, systems, and analytical tools needed to track and quantify risks.\nPolicies and Processes translate high-level risk appetite into operational guidelines and limits.\nThe Three Lines of Defense create organizational accountability—business operations own and manage risks, risk management provides oversight, and internal audit offers independent assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA critical insight: while organizations face countless potential risks, they’re typically driven by a small number of key risk factors. Effective risk management focuses on identifying and managing these critical drivers.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Risk Identification—Finding What Could Hurt You\nThe first challenge is discovering what risks you face. This requires systematic exploration beyond the obvious, because the risks that destroy organizations are often the ones they didn’t see coming.\nEffective identification combines multiple approaches. Risk workshops bring together diverse perspectives to brainstorm potential threats. Historical loss analysis examines past failures—both internal and at peer organizations—to identify patterns. Scenario analysis asks “what could go wrong?” and follows the implications through to their logical conclusions. Risk registers provide systematic taxonomies of known risk types, while external benchmarking reveals risks other organizations have identified.\nThe challenge lies in navigating three categories of risk knowledge:\n\nKnown Knowns: Risks we understand and can quantify (market volatility, credit defaults)\nKnown Unknowns: Risks we’re aware of but can’t fully measure (cyber attack severity, pandemic impacts)\nUnknown Unknowns: “Black Swan” events we haven’t imagined\n\nThe goal isn’t to identify every conceivable risk—that’s impossible. It’s to cast a wide enough net to catch the risks that could materially impact objectives while remaining alert to signals of emerging unknown risks.\n\n\n1.2.3 Risk Assessment—Prioritizing What Matters\nNot all risks deserve equal attention. Assessment evaluates both the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks to focus resources where they matter most.\nThe classic risk matrix provides a simple but powerful prioritization tool:\n\n\n\nLikelihood\nLow Impact\nMedium Impact\nHigh Impact\n\n\n\n\nHigh\nMedium\nHigh\nCritical\n\n\nMedium\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nLow\nLow\nLow\nMedium\n\n\n\nHigh-likelihood, high-impact risks demand immediate attention. Low-likelihood, low-impact risks might be accepted as a cost of doing business. The challenging decisions involve the corners: high-impact but unlikely events (prepare contingency plans) and likely but low-impact events (automate controls).\nAssessment isn’t purely mechanical. It requires judgment about probability and impact, consideration of risk velocity (how quickly a risk materializes), and understanding of risk interconnections that could amplify impacts.\n\n\n1.2.4 Risk Measurement—Quantifying the Unquantifiable\nMeasurement transforms vague concerns into actionable metrics. Different risk types require different measurement approaches, and choosing the right metric is crucial for effective management.\nFoundation metrics apply across risk types:\n\nProbability distributions show the range of potential outcomes\nStandard deviation measures dispersion, though it assumes normal distributions that rarely exist in practice\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) estimates maximum likely loss at a confidence level\nConditional VaR reveals average losses beyond the VaR threshold\nStress testing explores performance under extreme scenarios\n\nSpecialized metrics target specific risks:\n\nFor market risk, we use beta to measure systematic risk exposure, duration for interest rate sensitivity, and the “Greeks” for derivatives—delta (price sensitivity), gamma (delta’s rate of change), vega (volatility sensitivity), theta (time decay), and rho (interest rate sensitivity).\nFor credit risk, we estimate Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Credit ratings synthesize multiple factors into standardized risk grades.\n\nKey Risk Indicators (KRIs) serve as early warning signals—metrics that change before risks materialize, providing time to respond.\nThe challenge in measurement is balancing precision with practicality. Perfect measurement is impossible, but approximate measurement that acknowledges uncertainty is far better than no measurement at all.\n\n\n1.2.5 Risk Management—Choosing Your Response\nOnce risks are identified, assessed, and measured, organizations must decide how to respond. The four fundamental strategies can be combined for optimal results:\nRisk Avoidance eliminates risk by not engaging in the activity. A company might avoid entering politically unstable markets or decline to develop products with uncertain liability. This provides certainty but foregoes potential opportunities. The key question: is what we’re giving up worth the risk we’re avoiding?\nRisk Acceptance consciously retains risk, either because it’s unavoidable or because the cost of mitigation exceeds potential losses. This takes two forms. Self-insurance means bearing losses as they occur or setting aside reserves. Diversification spreads risk across uncorrelated exposures, reducing concentration while accepting that some risk remains.\nRisk Transfer shifts risk to parties better equipped to bear it. Insurance is the classic mechanism—insurers pool uncorrelated risks from many sources, using the law of large numbers to make aggregate losses predictable. The limitation: insurance becomes expensive or unavailable for risks that affect many parties simultaneously (pandemic, financial crisis).\nRisk Shifting uses derivatives to alter risk distribution without transferring ownership. A company might use currency forwards to lock in exchange rates or buy options to limit downside while preserving upside. The choice between forwards (obligation) and options (right but not obligation) depends on whether you want certainty or flexibility.\nThe decision process starts with a fundamental question: is the risk within our appetite? If yes, we optimize management costs. If no, we must reduce exposure through some combination of the four strategies, considering costs, benefits, risk tolerance, and operational capabilities.\n\n\n1.2.6 Risk Monitoring—Maintaining Vigilance\nRisk management isn’t “set and forget.” Continuous monitoring ensures controls remain effective and strategies stay aligned with changing conditions.\nEffective monitoring tracks KRIs against predetermined limits, providing early warning when risks approach unacceptable levels. It regularly updates risk assessments as business conditions change, tests control effectiveness through audits and reviews, runs stress scenarios to verify resilience, and adjusts strategies based on lessons learned.\nRisk reporting transforms monitoring data into actionable intelligence. Effective reports share six characteristics:\n\nTimely—delivered frequently enough for decision-making, which varies by risk type (market risk might need daily reports, strategic risk quarterly)\nAccurate—based on validated data and calculations stakeholders can trust\nRelevant—focused on material risks for the specific audience, avoiding information overload\nClear—understandable by intended recipients, avoiding unnecessary jargon\nActionable—enabling informed decisions with clear implications and recommendations\nComprehensive—covering all material risk areas without gaps that could hide emerging problems\n\nThe monitoring phase feeds back into identification, creating a continuous cycle of improvement. New risks emerge, existing risks evolve, and yesterday’s controls become today’s vulnerabilities. Only through constant vigilance can organizations maintain resilience in an uncertain world.",

    "text": "1.3 Governance and Organization\nRisk governance transforms risk management from compliance burden into strategic advantage through clear organizational structure and accountability. The hierarchy ensures risk awareness flows from boardroom to operations while information travels upward to inform decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk appetite defines what risks an organization willingly accepts pursuing objectives, while risk tolerance sets acceptable variation boundaries. Organizations operationalize these through cascading limits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart organizations set appetite well below capacity, maintaining buffers for unexpected shocks.\nRisk budgeting transforms abstract risk appetite into concrete allocations across the organization. Like financial budgeting allocates scarce capital, risk budgeting allocates scarce risk capacity to its most productive uses.\nRisk culture—shared attitudes and behaviors around risk—determines whether governance structures actually influence behavior. Strong culture exhibits four pillars: leadership tone from the top, clear accountability with consequences, effective challenge without retaliation, and risk-aligned incentives favoring long-term value over short-term profits. Poor culture reveals itself through profit-at-any-cost focus, suppressed concerns, and risk management viewed as impediment rather than enabler.\nModern risk governance creates value by optimizing risk-return trade-offs, enabling profitable activities others fear, and building competitive advantage through superior risk management. Success requires integration with business strategy, dynamic adaptation to changing conditions, and investment in capabilities matching strategic importance. The goal: risk management so embedded it becomes invisible yet omnipresent, influencing every decision without constraining innovation.",

    "section": "1.4 Modern Applications and Enterprise Risk Management",
    "text": "1.4 Modern Applications and Enterprise Risk Management\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) represents a paradigm shift from isolated risk silos to holistic risk management. Traditional approaches created blind spots at intersections where risks interact and amplify—credit crises become liquidity crises become market crises. ERM acknowledges that organizations are driven by a small number of key risk factors cutting across traditional boundaries.\nERM rests on five interconnected pillars:\n\nTargets align risk-taking with strategic objectives through enterprise-wide appetite statements and risk-adjusted metrics.\nStructure creates accountability through board oversight and cross-functional committees.\nIdentification and Metrics establish common risk language and aggregate measures.\nStrategies optimize risk-return trade-offs at portfolio level.\nCulture embeds risk awareness as organizational mindset rather than isolated function.\n\nModern risk management looks forward through stress testing that explores extreme conditions. Sensitivity analysis changes single factors, scenario analysis combines multiple changes, and reverse stress testing identifies what could cause failure. Testing uses both historical scenarios (2008 crisis, COVID-19) and hypothetical events (cyber attacks, climate catastrophes) to reveal vulnerabilities that normal metrics miss.\nNew risk categories demand attention as the world evolves. Climate risk operates through physical damage, transition costs, and stranded assets. Cyber risk grows more sophisticated with cascading systemic impacts. Artificial intelligence creates accountability gaps and amplifies model risk. Regulatory evolution accelerates with dynamic requirements across multiple frameworks (Basel III, Solvency II, COSO).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe fundamental insight: ERM transforms risk from threat to opportunity, from cost to investment, from necessary evil to competitive advantage. Organizations that master ERM don’t eliminate uncertainty—they harness it for sustainable value creation through intelligent risk-taking.",

Today’s exchange rate is €1 = $1.10, but it could move to anywhere between $1.00 and $1.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario B: Interest Rate Risk\n\n\n\nYour company has a €5,000,000 loan with a variable interest rate, currently at 4%. The rate is reviewed every 6 months and could move ±2%.\n\n\nBased on these two examples, how do the three risk components (driver, position, exposure) work together to create overall risk?\n\n\nExercise 2: Risk Identification\nReview the real events from recent years provided below. For each event, complete the following:\n\nIdentify all types of risks present in each event. Consider multiple perspectives - what could potentially go wrong for various stakeholders involved?\nClassify the identified risks into these four categories:\n\nFinancial/Market Risks\nOperational/Process Risks\nHuman/Behavioral Risks\nTechnology/System Risks\n\n\nThis exercise helps develop pattern recognition skills for identifying and categorizing different risk types across real-world scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent 1: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse (March 2023)\n\n\n\nSVB focused heavily on tech startups and held many long-term government bonds. When interest rates rose, bond values fell. The bank announced losses, customers panicked, and $42 billion was withdrawn in one day via mobile banking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent 2: Ever Given Ship (March 2021)\n\n\n\nA container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal for 6 days, blocking 12% of global trade. Oil prices rose, supply chains were disrupted, and some companies couldn’t deliver products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent 3: GameStop Stock Surge (January 2021)\n\n\n\nReddit users coordinated to buy GameStop stock, driving the price from $20 to $347. Hedge funds that bet against the stock lost billions. Some trading apps restricted purchases.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Risk Dominos\nPick ONE of the scenarios below and trace how problems might spread. Think about how one problem leads to the next:\n\nWeek 1: Original event happens\nWeek 2: What happens next?\nWeek 3: What new problems emerge?\nWeek 4: How does it spread further?\nWeek 5: What’s the final impact?\n\nCritical Thinking Questions:\n\nWhich step was hardest to predict?\nAt what point could the company have stopped the cascade?\nWhat does this tell you about managing risk?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario A: Cyber Attack\n\n\n\nA major bank’s computer systems are hacked, and customer data is stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario B: CEO Scandal\n\n\n\nThe CEO of a major company is arrested for fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario C: Factory Fire\n\n\n\nYour company’s main manufacturing plant burns down.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: The Coffee Shop Dilemma\nYou’re opening a coffee shop near campus. You’ve identified these potential problems:\n\nCompetitor opens next door: High chance, medium impact\nCoffee prices double: Low chance, high impact\nStudents switch to energy drinks: Medium chance, medium impact\nYour espresso machine breaks: High chance, low impact\nCampus shuts down (like COVID): Very low chance, very high impact\n\nSuggest suitable solutions:\n\nRank these risks from 1-5 (1 = deal with first, 5 = worry about last)\nFor your top 3 risks, what would you do and why? For each one, you can:\n\nAvoid it (don’t do things that create the risk)\nAccept it (live with it, maybe save money just in case)\nTransfer it (get someone else to bear the risk - like insurance)\nReduce it (take action to make it less likely or less damaging)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: The Risk Management System\nImagine you’re hired as “Chief Risk Officer” for a tech startup. The CEO says: “Just make sure nothing bad happens to us.”\n\nWhat would you tell the CEO about their request? What’s realistic and what isn’t?\n\nThe CEO is more reasonable now. They want you to “manage risks systematically.” Design your approach:\n\nWhat’s the very first thing you’d do?\nWhat comes next?\nHow would you measure things?\nWhat actions would you take?\nHow would you keep watching?\n\nWho should be responsible for risk management in the company?\n\nJust the risk manager\nSenior management\nAll employees\nBoard of directors\nExternal consultants\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Putting It All Together\nThink about everything you’ve worked through today. In your own words, define:\n\nRisk\nRisk Management\n\nThink of a major financial decision you’ve made (or will make soon) - buying a car, choosing a university, taking a job, etc.\n\nWhat risks did/do you face?\nHow did/will you manage them?\n\nYou’re in a job interview for a finance position. The interviewer asks: “Why should companies care about risk management?” Explain your opinion in 60s.",

What is the daily volatility?\nTask 1.2: If we define risk as “2-sigma events,” what loss level should we report for our $100M position?\nTask 1.3: Find the best and worst daily returns in the dataset. Are they roughly symmetric around the mean? What does this tell you about using standard deviation for risk measurement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP/L Convention\n\n\n\nWe use Profit/Loss (P/L) data where:\n\nPositive = profits (good)\nNegative = losses (bad)\n\nFor a $100M position:\n\nA -2% return means we lost $2 million\nA +1.5% return means we gained $1.5 million\n\nThis matches trader thinking and system reports.\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2: Discovery Through Sorting\nTask 2.1: Open SPY_returns_250.csv and sort the returns column from worst to best.

For now, these exercises demonstrate why regulators made this shift.\n\n\nActivity 5: Practical Applications\nTask 5.1: In 2016, Basel III shifted from VaR to ES for market risk capital. Using your SPY data, compare the old and new requirements:\n\nCalculate 99% VaR (old Basel II requirement)\nCalculate 97.5% ES (new Basel III requirement)\nDespite the lower confidence level, is the new requirement more or less conservative?\n\nTask 5.2: Calculate 99% VaR and 97.5% ES for all 250-day rolling windows.\n\nWhich 250-day window produces the highest VaR and ES?\nCompare the results with the most recent 250-day window.\nIf you had to hold capital for the worst-case historical period, how much more would you need?",

    "text": "Block D: Case Study - UBS and the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis\nUBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, suffered the biggest losses of any European bank during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Despite sophisticated risk models and AAA-rated assets, the bank lost over $37 billion on mortgage-related securities. This case illustrates how VaR models can catastrophically fail and why Expected Shortfall matters.\nBefore the Crisis (2005-2007):\n\nUBS held $50+ billion in “Super Senior” CDO tranches (the safest part of mortgage securities)\nThese were rated AAA - supposedly safer than US government bonds\nRisk models (like VaR) showed minimal danger because:\n\nHistorical data (2003-2006) showed tiny default rates\nMortgages across different regions were assumed independent\nThe bank bought insurance from monoline insurers as protection\nAssumed normal distributions and stable correlations\n\n\nDuring the Crisis (2007-2008):\n\nOctober 2007: UBS announces $3.4 billion loss (first major bank to report)\nFull year 2007: $18.7 billion in writedowns\nQ1 2008: Another $19 billion in losses\nStock price fell 70%, CEO and entire senior management resigned\n\nWhy Everything Failed:\n\nUS housing collapsed nationwide (not regionally as models assumed)\nAAA-rated securities became worthless\nInsurance companies failed (they insured the same mortgages)\nMarket liquidity vanished - couldn’t sell at any price\nLosses exceeded any historical scenario by 10-20x\n\n\nActivity 8: Discussion Questions\nTask 8.1: Model Assumptions\n\nIf historical data shows no defaults in AAA securities, what should your VaR be?\nShould risk models include events that have never happened?\nHow do you model risk for new products with limited history?\n\nTask 8.2: Risk Aggregation\n\nUBS claimed positions were “diversified” across different mortgages. What went wrong?\nIf correlation changes from 0.2 to 0.9 in crisis, how does this affect portfolio risk?\nCan diversification make risk disappear, or just hide it?\n\nTask 8.3: Lessons Learned\n\nWould higher capital requirements based on ES have prevented these losses?\nIf everyone uses similar risk models, what systemic risks emerge?\nWhy might a model that works for 99% of days still destroy a bank?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Lesson\n\n\n\nVaR’s blind spot: It tells you the threshold you won’t exceed 99% of the time, but nothing about what happens in that 1%.\nUBS’s fate: The 1% tail event wasn’t just slightly worse than VaR - it was catastrophically worse. This is why regulators switched to Expected Shortfall after the crisis.\nRemember: Risk models work well in normal times. They fail precisely when you need them most - during crises when correlations spike, liquidity vanishes, and “impossible” events happen.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nVaR’s fatal flaw: It tells you nothing about severity when breached—ES measures what actually happens in the tail\nCoherence matters: ES always rewards diversification (subadditive), while VaR can punish it, leading to perverse incentives\nDistribution choice is critical: Normal distributions underestimate tail risk; fat-tailed distributions (Student-t) better capture extreme events\nMonte Carlo extends our toolkit: When historical data is limited, simulation helps explore scenarios that haven’t happened yet\nRegulatory evolution has a reason: Basel III’s shift to ES wasn’t arbitrary—it directly addressed failures revealed in 2008\nModels fail when you need them most: UBS lost $37B despite “safe” VaR—risk models work in normal times but break in crises when correlations spike and liquidity vanishes\nThe practical bottom line: Always ask “If things go bad, HOW bad?”—that’s ES, and it might save your firm",
